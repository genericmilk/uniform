# 💂‍ Uniform
## By Genericmilk

A super small (13 lines!) script that makes your DOM elements resize to the height of the biggest

When you have a row of elements such as cards that may vary in content height (Such as one card having a different height to the other), this plugin will help you set the heights on all of these elements to the tallest so they appear uniform on the page

### To install

Simply include this script in your footer (Or better still, using Cooker at https://github.com/genericmilk/cooker 😉 add it to the `/resources/js/libraries` folder)

Then simply include `data-uniform="true"` on as many elements as you like!

On pageload, Uniform will resize the elements accordingly.

### Roadmap

Uniform will have a lot more customisation down the line including being able to group sets of uniformity, so one set may want different rules from the other! ☺️

Hope you find this script useful!
